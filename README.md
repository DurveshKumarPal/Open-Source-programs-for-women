- [BlackHoodie](https://www.blackhoodie.re/)

    BlackHoodie is a free, women only reverse engineering workshop. The motivation behind this workshop is to give female engineers the prospect of a comfortable learning environment.

Thus the idea to host events which would support one of infosec’s minorities, the ladies.
